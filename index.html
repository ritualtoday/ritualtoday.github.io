  <p>Nothing is accomplished unless it is actually done. For some of us, there is a gap between that point where our motivation ends and our ambitions, dreams, and visions start. That gap may be lack of discipline, lack of ritual, the wrong habits, or all three of them. The gap is the pervasive obsticle to reach our true potential. Together, we can bridge the gap and accomplish anything. It starts today and above all else, must continue daily.
