<p>Nothing is accomplished unless it is actually done. For some of us, there is a gap between that point where our motivation ends and our ambitions, dreams, and visions start. That gap is either lack of discipline, lack of ritual, the wrong habits, or all three of them. Together, we can bridge the gap and accomplish anything. It starts today and above all else, must continue daily.
